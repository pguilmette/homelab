### Getting Started
> Because the cluster uses the Cilium CNI, follow [this guide](/docs/cgroup-version-validation.md) to make sure that your Docker instance is using _cgroup v2_; otherwise, Cilium will fail to install properly.

To locally start a Kubernetes cluster using KinD (Kubernetes-in-Docker), you can create one quickly with the following steps:
1. Ensure you have the Pulumi CLI installed
2. Ensure you have Docker installed and running
3. In a console, go to the `infrastructure/kubernetes-cluster` directory
4. Log in to Pulumi locally: `pulumi login --local`
5. Create the cluster: `pulumi up --stack kind.local --yes`
> You will be asked for a passphrase to protect your infrastructure secrets. You can put anything you want.
6. Be patient ğŸ˜Š
